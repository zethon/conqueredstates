Conquered States was a multi-player web browser nation building game. It was based off of the website [Nation States](https://www.nationstates.net/) but incoporated maps of the real world where users could select their own territory and build there nation.

The game was in developement throughout 2006 and was taken offline before most of the features could be complete. 

## Design

Most of the game is implemented in PHP with a MySQL database. 

## The End

Because of personal reasons, the game was never completed. 

The code is presented here for archival purposes.
